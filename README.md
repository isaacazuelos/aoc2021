# Advent of Code 2021

(Some) Advent of Code solutions for 2021.

I don't have a lot of [previous experience with OCaml][cio], so I'm expecting to
drop out pretty quickly. I just wanted an excuse to play with it. Tooling has
always been a bit of a barrier for my attempts to use ocaml. I found this [blog
post] helpful.

Once you have `dune` working, you can run things with `dune exec bin/main.exe`.
